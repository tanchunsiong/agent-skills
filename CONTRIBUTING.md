2. Fork the repository
3. Create a feature branch
4. Follow the skill format guidelines below
5. Submit a pull request

## Skill Format Guidelines

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: |
  Brief description (1-3 sentences).
  Include when to use this skill.
---

# Skill Title

[Content following the template in PLAN.md]
```

### Guidelines

1. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - Move details to `references/`
2. **Max 3 directory levels** - `skill/references/file.md`
3. **Include code examples** - Real, working code developers can use
4. **Document gotchas** - Common mistakes and limitations
5. **Link to official sources** - Prefer Zoom documentation

## Using Claude for Contributions

You can use Claude (or other AI assistants) to help create or improve skills:

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Research Phase**
   ```
   Research the official Zoom documentation for [topic].
   Check the developer forum for common issues.
   Find working code examples.
   ```

2. **Drafting Phase**
   ```
   Create a skill following the SKILL.md template.
   Include practical code examples.
   Document known limitations and gotchas.
   ```

3. **Validation Phase**
   ```
   Cross-check all information with official Zoom docs.
   Verify code examples are syntactically correct.
   Ensure links are valid.
   ```

### Claude-Specific Tips

- **Be specific**: "Create a use case for RTMS audio streaming to S3" not "write about RTMS"
- **Provide context**: Share relevant existing skills as examples
- **Iterate**: Review drafts and ask for improvements
- **Verify**: Always cross-check AI-generated content with official sources

### What Claude Can Help With

| Task | How Claude Helps |
|------|------------------|
| Research | Search docs, forums, GitHub for information |
| Drafting | Create initial skill content following templates |
| Code examples | Generate working code snippets |
| Cross-referencing | Check consistency across skills |
| Formatting | Ensure markdown is correct |

### What Requires Human Review

| Task | Why Human Review |
|------|------------------|
| Technical accuracy | AI may hallucinate APIs or features |
| Real-world gotchas | Comes from actual development experience |
| Business logic | Zoom-specific requirements and policies |
| Security practices | Must be verified against official guidance |

## Quality Standards

### Do

- Verify all claims with official documentation
- Include working, tested code examples
- Document known limitations prominently
- Link to official resources
- Keep examples simple and practical

### Don't

- Include unverified information
- Speculate about undocumented behavior
- Copy proprietary code without permission
- Include outdated or deprecated APIs without noting it
- Over-engineer examples

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on improving the documentation
- Credit sources appropriately
- Follow Zoom's developer terms of service
