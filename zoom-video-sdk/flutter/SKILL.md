# Zoom Video SDK (Flutter)

Use this skill for Flutter apps that build custom real-time video session experiences with Zoom Video SDK.

## Quick Links

1. **[Lifecycle Workflow](concepts/lifecycle-workflow.md)** - init -> joinSession -> media/control -> leave -> cleanup
2. **[SDK Architecture Pattern](concepts/sdk-architecture-pattern.md)** - helper-based API surface and event model
3. **[High-Level Scenarios](concepts/high-level-scenarios.md)** - common product patterns
4. **[Setup Guide](examples/setup-guide.md)** - package setup + platform prerequisites
5. **[Session Join Pattern](examples/session-join-pattern.md)** - tokenized session join flow
6. **[Event Handling Pattern](examples/event-handling-pattern.md)** - listener mapping and action routing
7. **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - complete navigation

## Core Notes

- Video SDK sessions are custom sessions, not Zoom Meetings.
- Keep SDK credentials server-side; generate JWT token on backend.
- Integration is strongly event-driven; bind listener flows early.
- Feature support and enum names can drift by wrapper/native version.
